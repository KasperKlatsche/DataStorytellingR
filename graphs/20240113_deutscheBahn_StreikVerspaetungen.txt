What is the relationship between Deutsche Bahn's punctuality and the train strike? Trains become more punctual:
- Local transport -61% average delay and 72% cancellations
- Regional transport -54% avrg. delay and 51% cancellations
- Long distance transport -52% avrg. delay and 88% cancellations
- Non-DB providers -54% avrg. delay and 21% cancellations
So is the Deutsche Bahns delay problem a consequence of rail capacity bottlenecks?
