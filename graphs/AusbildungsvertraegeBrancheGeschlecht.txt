ðŸš€ Let's discuss the declining interest in apprenticeships (#Ausbildung) in Germany! Nobody will be suprised by a 22% drop in apprenticeship contracts in the time frame 2008-2022, but the decline is not uniform across sectors. Home economics (#Hauswirtschaft) with -67%, Craft (#Handwerk) with -23% and industry/trade (#IndustrieUndHandel) with -25% experience the most drastic decrease, while the public sector sees a 9% increase. ðŸ“‰

The #GenderGap is notable, with female apprentices experiencing a more drastic decrease (-32%) compared to their male counterparts (-15%). How can we reverse this trend and make apprenticeships appealing again? #FutureOfWork
